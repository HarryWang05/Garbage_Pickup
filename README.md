# Garbage_Pickup
This is my final CS project for my ICS 4UI high school course.

# What It Does
Garbage Pickup is a Processing program that is used to calculated the shortest or most convienient route for a garbage truck in a neighbourhood. Demo neighbourhoods are given, and users can edit txt files to make new layouts. Features include showcasing the exact path the garbage truck will take, and taking into consideration a capacity theof the garbage truck user can change.

# What Inspired Garbage Pickup?
Garbage Pickup was inspired by the relative inefficiency of garbage trucks. As they move around, they constantly stop and waste a lot of energy accelerating for short periods of time. With gas prices soaring, it is becoming an even bigger problem, and Garbage Pickup was designed to save costs on this specifically.
