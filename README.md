# What Inspired Garbage Pickup?
Garbage Pickup was inspired by the relative inefficiency of garbage trucks. As they move around, they constantly stop and waste a lot of energy accelerating for short periods of time. With gas prices soaring, it is becoming an even bigger problem, and Garbage Pickup was designed to save costs on this specifically.
